# How to clone the repository and contribute

This guide is a step-by-step guide on how to clone the repository locally and contribute changes to the project.

# 1. Cloning the repository

To have access to the repository locally, you need to have either Git or GitHub desktop installed. To clone the repository:

- If you're using git, clone the repository with:
    
        git clone https://github.com/arodovi852/Proyecto-Digi-2-trimestre

- If you're using GitHub desktop, go to "Open with GitHub Desktop" on the main page.



## 2. Create a new branch

If you're using Git, you should type:
    
    git checkout -b new-branch

This will create a new branch (make sure to give it a proper fitting name)

In Desktop, go to Current Branch and then press new branch

## 3. Add changes to your new branch

Edit the code or add files as needed. Once this is done, type:

    git add .

    git commit -m "description"

    git push origin new-branch

This will add your changes, commit them to the branch and then push your changes to the branch to save them.

On Desktop, all you need to do is add a description on the left corner, select commit and then select push changes.

## 4. Add your changes to main

Finally, you need to go to the page on GitHub and there youâ€™ll see a text that says "open a Pull Request".

You need to create the Pull Request, and once you do this you'll need to wait for someone to review your changes.

After being reviewed, they will be be accepted and thus you will have contributed to the project!
